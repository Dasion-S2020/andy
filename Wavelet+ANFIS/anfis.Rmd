This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("/Users/andyliu/develop/andy/Wavelet+ANFIS")
train_x <- read.csv(file = 'x_train.csv')
test_x <- read.csv(file = 'x_test.csv')
train_y <- read.csv(file = 'y_train.csv')
test_y <- read.csv(file = 'y_test.csv')
```

```{r}
test_x <- test_x[-c(1)]
train_y <- train_y[-c(1)]
test_y <- test_y[-c(1)]
train_x <- train_x[-c(1)]
train <- cbind(train_x, train_y)
```


```{r}
NL <- matrix(c(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2))
```

```{r}
Control <- list(num.labels = NL, max.iter = 10, step.size = 0.01, type.tnorm = 'PRODUCT', type.snorm = 'MAX', type.implication.func = 'MIN', name = 'APPLE')
```

```{r}
library(frbs)
```


```{r}
RD <- matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1), nrow=2, ncol=13)
RD
```

```{r}
obj <- frbs.learn(data.train=train, range.data=RD, method.type=c('ANFIS'), control=Control)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
